My code for the card game Casino (rules can be found here: http://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html).

If you want to play the game you'll need pygame. I'm working in Python 2.7. Run the file CasinoWhileLoop.py to play!

In the future I hope to add the following things:

-Making the computer player smarter (probably with levels to choose from since the computer wins against me sometimes as is!)

-Play online against another person (instead of the computer)

-Nice buttons that people expect, like "start a new game"

Enjoy!
